    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <h2>Subheading</h2>
    <p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
       Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
       For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>
